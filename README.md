# Java-Swing-Projects

This is my project for the User Interface course at York University. 
This GUI application for parking permit kiosks was developed using Oracle's Swing framework.
The application was written in Java using Eclipse IDE.
## How to run the application?
It is recommanded that you download the a1.zip file and import it into Eclipse to run the application.  
If you downloaded the parking_permit_kiosk folder and want to launch the application using the command line, please make sure the a1.class file is in the same location as the png images, companies.txt, and students.txt files. Otherwise, you will not see the icons and the complete insurance company selection interface. You will also not be able to pass the student login process, which requires information contained in the students.txt file.
### Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Pan Jiang and Keren Xu, who also contributed to this project. 
### Some thoughts
A single a1.java file is required as per the instructions of the project. However, I believe it is better to separate the codes in the a1.java file into several different files for better maintainability.
